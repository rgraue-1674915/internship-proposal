    <h1>Ryan Graue Internship Proposal</h1>
      <h2>Informatics</h2>
      <p >
        The analyzation, interpretation, and managment of data and information throughout
        its entire lifecycle to solve, create, and display tangible solutions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>3 Goals</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gain real world experience of how information travels, and how it can
            be use to the advantage of its owner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use my knowledge of how the systems work to enhance the flow of information
            and how to use that information to our advantage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Invest my talents in a company that I enjoy and believe in.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Java, R, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Markdown, Git/Github, SQL</li>
          <li>Statistical analysis and display using R and Python</li>
          <li>Create R shiny app sites</li>
          <li>MongoDB for cloud sharing databases and clusters</li>
          <li>Knowledge of how to learn</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Project ideas/daily operations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple statistical analysis of data</li>
          <li>Create visualizations based on said analysis</li>
          <li>Data collection, entry, and cleaning</li>
          <li>Use Data to answer questions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Time Frame</h2>
          <p>
            This is a long term goal for me, as I understand something like this does not happen over night.
            In my mind I see multiple different time frame options...
            <ol class="numbered list">
              <li>Start middle of November 2020.
                <p>
                  I have the chance to go to New Zealand for study abroad and would not
                  return until late November. This off course would also allow me to learn
                  more specific skills that evo sees as more prominent.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>Start Summer 2020.
                <p>
                  If evo has a place for me, I could start once my duties in the shop are not needed any more.
                  This of course would also allow me to focus my skills and learnings towards objectives and skills
                  that evo deems more useful and needed.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        <h2>Final Words</h2>
          <p>
            I know that this is a very large ask of me, but I beleive that the skills
            I have grant me the ability to start at the most basic level of this kind
            of work. Within the relm of e-commerce and the amount of data it creates
            makes it the perfect place to grow one's skills, while also doing something
            useful for the company. By simply making data visualizations to go along
            with financial reports, to looking at vast amounts of data to find and solve
            problems, all the way to creating and improving information systems, I would
            be more then grateful to be given the chance to any of these.
          </p>

          <p>
            For this Proposal I used the shiny apps package in R. Some features such
            as HTML, and CSS primairly do not mix entirely well on this platform. However,
            I chose this platform due to its great nature of making interactive visualizations,
            and its easy ability to host the program online.
