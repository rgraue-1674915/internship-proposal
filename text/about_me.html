    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am 20 years old, born and raised in the Washington. Lived in Sammamish
      for my childhood, and went to Eastside Catholic High School. Now I currently
      am a sophomore at UW. I live in a Christian men's house with 56 other guys
      called the 17th Ave house. Living in a house like this teaches you a lot
      about yourself and how to live and communicate with others. Not only is
      very fun, but it is also very challenging at times. Never the less it has
      been very fu and fruitful for me and I has lead me o some of my closest
      friends.

      Work experience wise is entirely comprised of two entities; Sambica and
      evo. I have worked the past four summers as at a summer camp on lake
      Sammamish called Sambica working as a boat driver. Working there for as
      long as I did, eventually granted me a lot of responsibility, trust and
      respect. All of which did not come easy, but I loved having it, and worked
      my hardest to keep up my reputation and to keep that respect. I loved
      working there, not only was it fun and I was doing it with my best friends
      , but I was also the go to guy for anything that needed to get done. Which
      that latter of the two was possibly my favorite. My boss and I had a
      special relationship, and I defintilely learned not only boat skills, but
      also life skills on how to be a great employee and how to earn respect
      from employers. After this last summer I reached out and started to work
      part time in the ski shop at evo Seattle. Not only has this been great
      fun meeting people and learning tons, not just about skis. I have
      continued my work ethic, and I believe that if you ask anyone at the shop
      they will attest to it as well. It even as got me as much as a free new
      pair of skis from Frank this last February.

      Currently I am finishing up my winter quarter at UW, still working at the
      shop, applying to my major, and potentially going abroad for the Autumn
      quarter to New Zealand. All of this is partially why I wanted to start
      this conversation as early (in my mind) as I am. I truly believe that
      a place such as evo, being a large retail entity, has great potential for
      data science and analytics to improve much of how it operates. That being
      said, I know that I am still in school, and am asking a lot, but I believe
      that this would be a great oportunity for both parties; evo and I, to
      explore this new and intersting field and to see how evo can benefit from
      it.
