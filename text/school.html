    <h1>Schooling</h1>
      <p>
        Currently I am a Sophomore At the UW planning on majoring in Informatics
        with the specific track of information systems within the program. I will
        be applying for the major at the end of this winter quarter. Which is partially
        why I am trying to start this conversation of an internship so early, so that
        I might be able to put it into my application for school.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have so far made the Dean's list every quarter, and have taken at least
        one coding class per quarter to stay on top of my skills.

        Below I have embeded my unofficial transcript for my college career so
        far.
